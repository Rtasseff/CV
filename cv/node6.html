Ph.D.&nbsp;research, Ph.D.&nbsp;and Masters level coursework, selected courses: Statistical Physics (PHYS653),
Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos (PHY578), The Nucleus (BIOBM639) and Systems Biology in Medicine (CHEME544).

<EM>Graduate student advisor and team leader for multiple undergraduate research projects.</EM>
<BR>
Overall I mentored 30+ students working on projects involving Androgen Dependence of Prostate Cancer,
Differentiation of HL-60, ErbB signaling in Estrogen Negative Breast Cancer and Computational/Software Development.  
Although, students were primarily undergraduates I have had the opportunity to mentor a rotational PhD student, three masters students and
an extremely motivated high school student.
The primary objective was to offer a setting for students to observe and participate in academic research, 
and several students were able to devote multiple years to specific projects; 
these students are included in conference and article publications/submissions.

<EM>Constructed, organized and maintained Olin Hall shared mammalian cell culture facility.</EM>
<BR>
I oversaw purchasing of lab supplies and equipment, with $40K+ budget,
for construction of a new Olin Hall lab space.  The goal was to
assemble a lab space for multiple chemical engineering groups to perform general sterile tissue culture techniques.
The facility contains laminar flow hoods for sterile culturing, incubators for storage,
and optics for manual and automated inspection. 
Currently two separate lab groups operate in the facility, with plans for three additional groups in the near future.   
The facility was also the first space available for independent experimental research in my particular group.

<P>
<EM>Instructed mammalian cell culture module for Masters of Engineering program.</EM>  <B>Fall 2010</B>
<BR>
I was responsible for planning curriculum for a new class being offered to incoming masters student.
The overall course was a two part module, each lasting approximately seven weeks,
to train students in general mammalian and bacterial culture and techniques. 
Personal responsibilities included maintenance of the facility, design of the experiments, planning of the curriculum
and general instruction.
Over the semester I ran two complete modules that enrolled eleven students in total.
